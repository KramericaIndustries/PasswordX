Here I am going to details changes made to the core of the C5.

1. version
/concrete/config/version.php is modified to display the version of the Password, instead of the Concrete5

2. themes
/concrete/themes/ 
removed bloat themes

3. Test Paths
in /concrete/core/controllers/single_pages/install.php
testFileWritePermissions() changed from private to protected
